#### Reviews consist of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- List of reviews given by people for a certain company they have worked for.
- Each review card has an **name**, **job**, **image**, **text** along with the buttons.
- Buttons have been implemented to navigate through the reviews i.e., **Right** for forward, **Left** for backward and a **Surprise Me** for a random review.
- Data is handled by the `data.js` file.
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
